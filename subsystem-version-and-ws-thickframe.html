  <p>I always thought it was just an intended change made by the WinForm development team. I was wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since Visual Studio 2012, the WinForm designer uses thick window frame even if the form border style is <code class="highlighter-rouge">FixedSingle</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/vs2015-designer-fixedsingle.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>This is how thing was looked like back in the older version of Visual Studio.</p>

<p><img src="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/vs2008-designer-fixedsingle.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Do you ever wonder why? Here’s the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because since 2012, Visual Studio requires NT6.0 (Windows Vista) to run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be more precise, it is because the subsystem version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">devenv.exe</code> is set to 6.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-is-subsystem-version">What is subsystem version?</h3>

<p>Inside every EXE file, there is a <strong>PE header</strong> which provides various information about the file. For example, it will tell if the EXE file is designed for x86, IA64 or AMD64 processor. There is a field that tells if the EXE file should be started with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Console</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Windows</code> subsystem, and it also contains the <strong>minimum Windows version required to run the EXE.</strong></p>

<p>This explains that why sometimes you don’t even have a chance to run a certain program, if your OS version is quite old.</p>

<p><img src="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/win2k-cant-run-sdelete.png" alt="img" /></p>

<h3 id="and-ws_thickframe-would-be">And WS_THICKFRAME would be…?</h3>

<p>In simple word, it is a window style that determines if the window can be resized or not. In the old days where DWM is not enabled, resizable window has thicker window border than unresizable window, hence the name.</p>

<h3 id="arent-they-totally-unrelated">Aren’t they totally unrelated?</h3>

<p>I had the same thought too, until this happened to me.</p>

<p>I was developing a Win32 GUI framework. During debugging, I found an inconsistent behavior between the build that compiled using MSVC2005 and MSVC2015. The test subject was toggling the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Resizable</code> (which toggle the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WS_THICKFRAME</code>). In MSVC2015 build, the client size remained the same. In MSVC2005 build, <strong>the client size changed</strong>.</p>

<p>So I tried to pinpoint the root cause of problem. With debugger, I found the problem was occured at a line of code. The code would call <code class="highlighter-rouge">SetWindowLong</code> the <code class="highlighter-rouge">GWL_STYLE</code> to enable or disable the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WS_THICKFRAME</code> window style. So I coded <a href="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/test.cpp">a minimal Win32 C++ GUI app</a> just to see what would happen when I toggled the style.</p>

<video controls=""><source src="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/test.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>

<p>WTF? Fine, I changed my mind, I wanted to run the EXE in my Windows XP guest and see what would happen. <strong>I used the <code class="highlighter-rouge">editbin</code> to modify the subsystem version number.</strong> (For the record, I never install Windows XP targeting toolset because I don’t want to.)</p>

<p><img src="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/sendto-editbin.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>I ran the program again, and after I toggled the style, <strong>the client size changed.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wait. Visual Studio 2010 is the last version that runs on Windows XP, while Visual Studio 2012 is the first version that starts to use thick window frame for <code class="highlighter-rouge">FixedSingle</code>. They were connected, weren’t they?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got it now! I always thought it was just an intended change made by the WinForm development team. I was wrong.</p>

<h3 id="lets-prove-with-proof">Let’s prove with proof</h3>

<p>First, a WinForm application that toggles <code class="highlighter-rouge">FixedSingle</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sizable</code> form border style. Test the program <strong>before and after changing subsystem version to 6.0</strong> with a batch file that calls <code class="highlighter-rouge">editbin</code>. <a href="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/set-vista-as-min-winver.cmd">set-vista-as-min-winver.cmd</a></p>

<video controls=""><source src="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/proof-winform.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>

<p><a name="winform-workaround"></a>
Well, the client size doesn’t change, but you can see that something is off. I guess WinForm has workaround like</p>
<div class="language-c++ highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">ToggleResizable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">bool</span> <span class="n">val</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">auto</span> <span class="n">size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">GetClientSize</span><span class="p">();</span>
	<span class="n">RealToggleResizable</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="n">SetClientSize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, let’s try this trick on Visual Studio 2015. I modify the subsystem version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">devenv.exe</code>, and see if anything changes.</p>

<video controls=""><source src="/myblog/assets/posts/subsystem-version-and-ws-thickframe/proof-vs2015.mp4" type="video/mp4" /></video>

<p>See? With just a change of a byte, we can get back the good-old thin window border in Form Designer again.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>If you’re developing with WinForm, then good for you, you don’t actually have to do anything, because you can assume the client size never change by itself. That little oddity is not really a big matter. Who would toggle the window style every two seconds?</p>

<p>If you’re developing Win32 application, then you have to make up your mind. Set subsystem version to 6.0 is probably the most easy thing to do, but it is not consistent enough IMO because the size still changes if user is using Windows Classic theme. You might want to use the <a href="#winform-workaround">WinForm workaround I proposed</a> up there. If you really want the ultimate consistency (like me), then you should never toggle the <code class="highlighter-rouge">WS_THICKFRAME</code>. There are other ways to prevent the window from resizing, I will leave that to you.</p>
