Hello world! Do you like coding?

For now, I am obsessed with WinAPI, but I am trying to embrace other technology too, just not much at the moment. In fact WinAPI is the key that pushed me to understand a lot of things in C and C++ programming. I like the freedom of being able to invent anything you want. I like how WinAPI enabled me to override many things about Windows. If you have a good idea sorted out, and you can afford to invest a lot of time and effort, you can develop anything you want.

Now about myself. I am a Chinese Malaysian living in the captial city of Malaysia. Currently I'm still pursuring for bachelor degree in Multimedia Computing, but I'm always looking for good opportunity to get myself started in IT-related career. Send me a mail if your team is in need of a not-so-newbie newbie that can deal with C, C++, HTML, JS, CSS, C#, Java programming language.
